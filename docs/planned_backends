The following backends are planned for the initial release:

 - Xapian (because the author knows it extremely well)
 - Whoosh (because it is convenient to have a pure-python backend, and this will also test out support for backends for which the schema cannot be changed dynamically)
 - ElasticSearch (because it's very easy to talk to, and rather cool)

High priority backends for subsequent releases are:

 - Solr
 - Sphinx

Other backend plans:

 - Redis (ie, a search engine implemented in python, using Redis for storage, and using Redis set intersection and related operations for performing searches)
